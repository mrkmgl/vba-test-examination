# Testing the User through Questions in VBA

The assignment is called Derivatives Training. The main objective is to create a mock exam to let the user practice on derivatives. The user must be able to insert the answers via several input boxes. The mock exam is composed of 15 questions and 3 difficulty levels. The user is allowed to reply wrongly maximum
to 7 questions. Instead, if the user gets 4 answers right in a row, s/he passes to the next level. The exam stops at 15 questions, showing both the final score or a message warning that s/he has to have more practice before the exam.
